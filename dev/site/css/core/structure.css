/* ========================== STRUCTURE/CONTENT ======================= */

/*
 *
 * This is where you place the main structure of your pages, avoid using IDs as much as possible (favor classes),
 * specially for styling child elements (e.g. `#header li`) since it will probably create specificity nightmares
 * create a new class instead (e.g. `.headernav li`).
 *
 * I usually keep IDs for the #wrapper (wraps whole page content, gives more flexibility than using just the body tag), 
 * #header (main site header), #footer (main site footer), #content (main content area) and sometimes #sidebar, 
 * #mainnav and #subnav.
 *

#wrapper{overflow:hidden; /* overflow is important for grid (it should be set on the .gridholder parent element). that way we don't need to use classes like .last, .end, .omega or wrap each row into a different container or wrap .gridholder into another container */}

.innerwrapper{width:966px; margin:0 auto}
