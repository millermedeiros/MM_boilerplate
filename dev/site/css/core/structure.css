/* ========================== STRUCTURE/CONTENT ======================= */

/*
 *
 * This is where you place the main structure of your pages, avoid using IDs as
 * much as possible (favor classes), specially for styling child elements (e.g.
 * `#header li`) since it will probably create specificity nightmares create
 * a new class instead (e.g. `.headernav li`).
 *
 * I usually keep IDs for the #wrapper (wraps whole page content, gives more
 * flexibility than using just the body tag), #header (main site header),
 * #footer (main site footer), #content (main content area) and sometimes
 * #sidebar, #mainnav and #subnav since they usually needs to be accessed
 * through JavaScript.
