# r.js

A command line tool for running JavaScript scripts that use the
[Asychronous Module Defintion API (AMD)](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition)
for declaring and using JavaScript modules and regular JavaScript script files.

It is part of the [RequireJS project](http://requirejs.org), and works will with
the RequireJS implementation of AMD.

r.js is a single script that has two major functions:

* Run AMD-based projects in Node and Rhino.
* Includes the RequireJS Optimizer that combines scripts for optimal browser
delivery.

Releases of r.js are kept in the **dist** directory. To build your own from
the files in this repo, run:

    node dist.js

That will generate an r.js file in the same directory as dist.js


# Running AMD-based projects

If your JS project's main application file is called main.js, then do
the following:

## Node

    node path/to/r.js main.js

Requires Node 0.4 or later.

r.js allows using Node modules installed via npm. For more info see the
[Use with Node](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) docs.

## Java

Java requires some JAR files in the CLASSPATH for it to work:

* [rhino.jar](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/lib/rhino/js.jar?raw=true) from the [Rhino project](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/).
* [compiler.jar](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/lib/closure/compiler.jar?raw=true) if you are using the optimizer and want to use
[Closure Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/).

Download those files to your machine. To run r.js, you can use this type of
command:

### OS X/Linux/Unix:

    java -classpath path/to/rhino/js.jar:path/to/closure/compiler.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main r.js main.js

### Windows

    java -classpath path/to/rhino/js.jar;path/to/closure/compiler.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main r.js main.js

If you want to run it in the debugger, replace
org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main with
**org.mozilla.javascript.tools.debugger.Main**.

All further examples will use the Node notation, but substitute **node r.js** in the commands with the appropriate java command.

# Optimizer

The optimizer can be run by passing the **-o** command to r.js:

    node r.js -o path/to/buildconfig.js

See the [Optimization doc](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) for more
information on the optimizer.

## What makes it special

The optimizer is better than using a plain concatenation script because it runs
require.js as part of the optimization, so it knows how to:

* Use [Loader Plugins](http://requirejs.org/docs/plugins.html) to load non-script
dependencies and inline them in built files.
* [Name anonymous modules](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#modulename).
If your optimization step does not do this, and you use anonymous modules, you
will get errors running the built code.

# Other r.js commands

## Get Version

To get the version of r.js and the version of require.js used by r.js:

    node r.js -v

## Convert CommonJS modules

To convert a directory of CommonJS modules to ones that have define() wrappers:

    node r.js -convert path/to/commonjs/dir output/dir

Most, but not all, CommonJS modules can be converted to define()-wrapped modules
and still work.

However, there are some modules that may fail if:

* They use code branches like if/else or try/catch to call require(). There are
problems supporting this kind of dynamic module calls in an async environment.
* Some kinds of circular dependencies will not work right. The kinds that fail
are normally very brittle and depend on the execution order of the dependent
modules.

# Directory layout

**NOTE**: If you clone this repository, it **must** be a sibling to a clone of the
[RequireJS repository](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs), where that
repository is called **requirejs**. Otherwise the tests will not run.

* **dist.js**: the script that builds r.js
* **require.js**: the version of require.js to include in r.js
* **dist** the directory containing releases of r.js
* **build**: The files that make up the optimizer. dist.js includes a list of
the files from this directory to build into r.js.
* **lib**: The Java libraries for Rhino and Closure Compiler. Only needed if using
Java/Rhino to run r.js
* **tests**: command line tests. Run it under Node and Rhino by doing ../r.js all.js

dist.js takes the build/jslib/x.js file and injects the require.js files and other
files from the build/jslib directory into it.

If you make changes to any of those files, you will need to run **node dist.js**
to generate a new r.js. Be sure to run it through the tests , using both Node
and Java/Rhino:

    * node dist.js
    * cd tests
    * node ../r.js all.js
    * java -classpath ../lib/rhino/js.jar:../lib/closure/compiler.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main ./r.js all.js
    * cd ../build/tests
    * node ../../r.js all.js
    * java -classpath ../../lib/rhino/js.jar:../../lib/closure/compiler.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main ../../r.js all.js

# Contributing code changes

See the [RequireJS Contributing](http://requirejs.org/docs/contributing.html)
page for info on how to contribute code/bug fixes to this project.

Use GitHub pull requests to point to code changes, although for larger changes,
contact the [requirejs mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/requirejs)
to discuss them first.

# Doing a release

To do a release of version 0.0.0:

* git checkout -b 0.0.0
* Make sure the right version of require.js is in the project.
* Modify build/jslib/x.js to update the r.js version number in two places.
* node dist.js
* Run the tests (see above). They should pass. :)
* mv r.js dist/r-0.0.0.js
* git add dist/r-0.0.0.js
* git commit -a -m "Release 0.0.0"
* git tag -am "Release 0.0.0" 0.0.0
* git checkout master
* git merge 0.0.0
* git push origin master
* git push --tags
* git branch -d 0.0.0

Update the RequireJS download site to point to the latest release.
